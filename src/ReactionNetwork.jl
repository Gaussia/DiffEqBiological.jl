#     (kDegX, kDegY, kDegZ), (X,Y,Z) --> ∅
# - Modify variable replacement so that p, t, u and du can be used as input variable names or reaction rates.
#     Low prio.
# - Add support for converting to polynomials and use algebraic methods (fincing equilibirumpoints etc.)
#     Long term.

#Declare various arrow types symbols used for the empty set (also 0).

"""
Macro that inputs an expression corresponding to a reaction entwork and output a Reaction Netqork Structure that can be used as input to generation of SDE and ODE and Jump problems.
Must arrows accepted (both right, left and bi drectional arrows).
Using arrows no fileld arrows (⇐, ⟽, ⇒, ⟾, ⇔, ⟺) will disable mass kinetics and lets you cutomize reaction rates yourself.
Example system:
    2.0, X + Y --> XY       #This will have reaction rate corresponding to 2.0*[X][Y]
    2.0X, X + Y ⟾ XY       #This will have reaction rate corresponding to 2.0*[X]
    (hill(X,2,2,2),kD), X + Y ⟷ XY    #Reaction in forward direction is activated by X according to a hill function. Reaction in backward direction have a rate according to constant kD, declared elsewere in your program.
Note that while --> is a correct arrow, neither <-- nor <--> works.
